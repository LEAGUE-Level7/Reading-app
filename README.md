# Reading-app


## Goal
We set out to make a application that let you read books with an easy to use app that let you download and read picture books with a simple and easy to use interface.

## Features
You are able to go from your library and scroll through pages of books and click on any book in the library which opens it. The books have pictures and text at the bottom able to easily click on arrows to go between pages and click the home icon to return to the library. There is a search bar at the top to search for books in your library or the store. From the library you can go to the store by clicking the store button at the top. In the store you are able to search for books and click on the book where you are prompted whether you want to download the book. If you click yes, the book is downloaded and added to the library.
